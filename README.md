## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The Ground clearance and vehicle weight coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. The slope of the multiple linear

regression model is non-zero since we calculated the coefficients of the multiple linear regression model, and it has values other than zero. This model can be 

considered to be able to predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes in a great manner, Because the r-value of this linear model is more than 0.7 and r squared of 0.71, which

represents a strong correlation between the data and the model.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

As requested from the design specifications for the Mechacar suspension coils, we mustn't exceed a variance of 100 PSI for our manufacturing lots. Lot 1 and 2 passed the

variance test, whereas lot 3 exceeded the given 100 PSI variance of the suspension coils. The table clearly states the variances of these lots.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

The PSI across all manufacturing lots is the same as the population mean, since the p value is 0.97, which is higher than our 0.05 threshold.

The PSI of the first manufacturing lot is significantly different from the population mean, since the p value is 0.0038, which is lower than our 0.05 threshold.

The PSI of the second manufacturing lot is significantly different from the population mean, since the p value is 0.0204, which is lower than our 0.05 threshold.

The PSI of the third manufacturing lot is the same as the population mean, since the p value is 0.621, which is higher than our 0.05 threshold.
